# Time-delayed-COVID-19-virus-propagation-dynamic-model

The above matlab file is a time-delayed virus propagation dynamic model, and the prediction result is very similar to the real situation. In addition, you can use the Chinese epidemic situation to infer some unpublished epidemic data in the United States, which is very helpful for the model.

The model is as follows:
