# Time-delayed-COVID-19-virus-propagation-dynamic-model

The above matlab file is a time-delayed virus propagation dynamic model, and the prediction result is very similar to the real situation. In addition, you can use the Chinese epidemic situation to infer some unpublished epidemic data in the United States, which is very helpful for the model.

The model is as follows:

The notations are as follow:

And the comparison between the predicted value and the true value is as follows:

The (A_D,A_I,A_R) represents the nummber of (death, positive_now, recover) patients in America.

The (C_D,C_I,C_R) represents the nummber of (death, positive_now, recover) patients in China.

Hubei_I and NY_I represent the number of positive_now patients in Hubei and New York.
